### 5.5 Legal and Ethical concerns
Intellectual property (IP)
A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights

Digital Divide:
Unequal distribution of access to technology

### 5.6 Safe Computing
Personally Identifiable information (PII): Information specific to individual
Social security number
Age
Race
Phone #
Date of birth
Email address
Mailing address
Can be used to steal someone’s data
Search engines maintain our search history 
Used to enhance a user’s online experience
Can be exploited if protections are ignored
Google, Facebook, and Twitter gather lots of information based on what you search and post
Lots of risks to privacy as your activity is recorded and kept in data
Information put on the internet does not go away
Internet is an integral part of our lives
Phishing
An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information, like usernames and passwords
Phising emails look like they are from a company that you know
Bank
Credit card company
Social networking site
Video streaming service
Online Store
Click on a link or opening an attachment
Clicking on a link or opening an attachment can install a virus or a bad website
Keylogger:
Records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information
Rogue Access Point:
A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks



Authentication measures are strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
Protects devices and information from unauthorized access
Create strong passwords have requirements to make them more complex/secure
Multi-factor authentication: what you know, what you are, what you have
Virus and malware can get access to systems and affect it
Asymmetric encryption:
Public key for encrypting
Private key for decrypting


## Github Actions

### 5.1 Actions
Beneficial/harmful effects of computing
Benefits
Increased efficiency in production of everyday goods which decreases costs, Decreased need for paper and paper products which saves trees, Increased productivity for general daily tasks ie; typing is faster than writing notes physically which increases productivity.
	Harms
Creation of gambling/gacha games which makes it very easy for people to fall victim to gambling addiction, Easy to access illegal content which may facilitate crimes, requires lots of energy and manufacturing which may increase the amount of pollution
Dopamine issues?
Dopamine issues within our generations are definitely a real problem. With easy access to many things that can give you instant gratification, it can create too much constant dopamine. This would numb you to dopamine and require more to feel the same joys and highs you previously would, very similar to reactions when taking drugs. It creates a sort of addiction which can be linked back to computers and access to pretty much anything whenever you want

### 5.2 Actions
How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?
The digital world has access to so much info at once that you can empower yourself simply by learning from the massive amounts of data on the web. 
How to empower someone who is not empowered?
A way to help empower others is to teach. Take the info you’ve learned online and through the web to help others learn, especially if they don’t have access to those same resources you have. Even at Del Norte we can help empower others through teaching them how to better utilize and use their technology to its fullest capabilities
Is red tape blocking digital empowerment?
I think red tape does block digital empowerment often. Here at Del Norte we are pretty well off, the only red tape blocking us is the internet which sometimes blocks sites we could use for learning more about coding. For the most part it isn’t that bad though. HOwever in other places, there are likely lots of things preventing digital empowerment. All policies have to go through bureaucracy and so it may take time before other people are able to digitally empower themselves due to restrictions and blocks placed in front of them.

# Create Task Project
## Ideas

* Side Scroller animal game
* Animal quiz
* Animal based puzzle game
* Calculator with animal facts based on number found

# Final Idea

My original idea (side scroller animal game) is out of my skill level, and also, I don't think it will fill all requirements. Instead, I will make a guesser quiz. The quiz will give an animal based question and four possible answers, the player must choose the correct answer then continue to the next question.

| Requirement | Application in Code |
| --- | --- |
| One list (or other collection type) | List of animal questions and answers |
| One procedure | Function to generate new questions after answering |
| Algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration | Function to determine if answer is correct |
| Calls to student developed procedure | calls to different procedures within procedures such as nextQuestion from a gameStart function |
| User Input | Answers given for each question |
| Instructions for output | Shows if submitted answer is correct or wrong |

code is working, need to develop list of questions and answers to create actual quiz now; still need to add navbar
