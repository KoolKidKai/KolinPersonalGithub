# Data Structures Project

**Final Idea**

Our final project idea will be a code tutorial website. The project is sponsored by DNHS HackClub run by Rishi Peddekama and Arnav Palkhiwala.
The website will have multiple pages worth of tutorials from beginner to advanced coding concepts and will have some sort of rewards/points system when a coder completes a task.
We think creating a hackathon page in which coders can compete to complete tasks fastest or the best would be in the future as well.
